Make sure you also have yarn package manager installed in yourcomputer, since this project uses yarn workspaces.After cloning the project, at the project root run `yarn` to install all the dependencies. This process may take a while.After having the dependencies installed you can start the server by running `yarn start:server`. You will then be ableto access `https://localhost:3333/graphiql` to see the graphql playground for the API.The mobile client of this project is currently under development and is quite usable already. If you want to check themobile client run:- `yarn start:mobile:ios`. This will launch the iPhone simulator and start the iOS project (mac only - requires xcode).- `yarn start:mobile:android`. Make sure to have an Android simulator up and running before firing this command.## The mobile APPRunning the mobile app will present you with an auth page.
